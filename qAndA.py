Since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have become availible. Fundamentally, cryptocurrencies are specifications reguarding the use of currency which seek to incorporate principles of cryptography to implement a distributed, decentralized, and secure information economy. When comparing cryptocurrencies to fiat money, the most notable difference is in how no group or individual may accelerate, stunt, or in any other way significantly abuse the production of money. Instead, only a certain amount of cryptocurrency is produced by the eintire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate which is bounded by a value both prior defined and publicaly known.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency",
			r"(?i)(What|explain).+(halving|halvening)\?":lambda: "The halvening means, when we are at the 100.000 block block reward will be half of what it's today. Now for every block we \"mine\", we get 0 - 1,000,000 Dogeocoins. After the \"halvening\" we will get 0 - 500,000 per \"mined\" block. So, for every 100,000 blocks we \"mine\", block reward get smaller. In conclusion, this so called \"halvening\" will occur every 100,000 blocks until the block reward are at 0 - 10,000 Dogecoins only. By then we hit that, we will have mined all 100 billion dogecoins there are, so after that an additional 5 billion will be added per year with 0 - 10,000 block reward. That means 5% more doges first year, next year around 4.8% and it keeps lowering for every year. (percentage lowers, not amount of doges which still is 5 billion a year).

Pros - The above places are very fast and can get you doge TODAY.\n\n
Cons - You will pay a higher premium per doge going this route due to convenience. You are dealingwith an individual person, not a bank/marketplace here. Please beware of conartists on ebay and dogemarket and make sure they have a good history of selling.""",
